Well I want appreciate to myself because I've done this website under 24 hours, it feels like hackathon fr üòÇ üëè

### Tech Stack for This Website's Development

- Next.js
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Atomic design pattern
- Tailwind-merge
- VSCode
- Git
- lucide-react

### Why I choose Next.js?

well, its simply because this is travel website. It's important for travel website to implement SEO, and as we know, Next.js is super for SEO friendly with their SSR. For styling, I use tailwind. it's super easy to use and maintainable.

### Highlights of This Project

- **Separate component using atomic design pattern**. Yes, you can see I separated some components into ui, molecules, and section component. Implemented atomic design patter will be super easy to manage our components.

- **Conditional rendering component for destination card**. I implemented conditional direction on Destination Card List component using `index % 2`. Simply it will render different direction for destination card component.

- **proxy to hide real api url**. It will help us to protect our api url, so everyone can't see our real api url

- **implemented local font**. We need font that not ready on google fonts, so we've to use it locally, but not in our local computer, it's in our project.

- **separate importing line**. I like neatness. Well this is not required but when we implemented this, we can see clearly between where the global import, components import, and static import ü§ì

- **built my own slideshow**. I know this is something easy to do, but not everyone is willing to do it. Most of them prefer using libraries, even though it can affect performance.

## How about the performance?

Every website need performance because if the website load more than 10 seconds, user will go away ‚ò†Ô∏è
